    "message": "In this window you're wearing the $SPAN_OPEN$$HAT_NAME$$SPAN_CLOSE$ hat. For web requests made by this window, you can choose to allow $LINK_OPEN$Hatrack$LINK_CLOSE$ to handle browser cookies, rather than letting Chrome itself do so. Every time you request a resource from a domain that you haven't requested while wearing this hat before, you will be asked if you want $LINK_OPEN$Hatrack$LINK_CLOSE$ to handle browser cookies for that domain. In this way, you'll be able to log into the same website using different accounts in different $LINK_OPEN$Hatrack$LINK_CLOSE$ windows, even if the website itself doesn't allow that. $LINK_OPEN$Hatrack$LINK_CLOSE$ syncs your domain preferences, but not the cookies themselves, so you'll have to log in again every time you open a new window with $LINK_OPEN$Hatrack$LINK_CLOSE$. Have fun and enjoy wearing your $SPAN_OPEN$$HAT_NAME$$SPAN_CLOSE$ hat!",
